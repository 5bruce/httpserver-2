I am writing this HTTP server as a learning tool with a focus on performance.

Features:
-Clean, documented code
-Efficient socket management with kqueue
-Easy to understand HTTP protocol parser (from my ByteBuffer project)
-Runs on Linux*, FreeBSD, OS X

* When compiling on Linux, you must link with pthreads & libkqueue

Benchmarks:
Coming soon!
